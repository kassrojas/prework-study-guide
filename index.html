        <ul>
          <li>HTML: hypertext markup language; gives the content structure</li>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements that are nested inside other elements.
            Parent elements hold all the children.
          </li>
          <li>"Element" refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
        
          <li>ul, ol, and li represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items, respectively.

        <ul>
          <li>CSS: cascading style sheets; gives the content style</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When creating an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file using the HTML 'link' element. 
            'rel' attribute within 'link' element specifies relationship between current docs and linked doc resource. 
            'href' specifies location, URL, of external resource. </li>
            <li>external CSS file is linked to html inside the 'head' element since the 'head' element contains 
              meta information for the browser.

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <li>Default branch is called "main". We only code on feature branches. 
            In order to merge our changes to the main branch, we need to open a pull request. </li>

          <li>Pull request, PR, is used to merge a comparison branch (feature branch) into the base branch.
            Once the PR is open, developers and collaborators can view those changes. Once PR is approved, it can be merged to the main branch.
            Now everytime you make a new branch, it will add it to this updated main branch.
          </li>
          <li>git add -A command commits all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m ... use -m to associate a message with your commit</li>

        <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. 
          Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform. </li>
         <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
