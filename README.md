# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
    The Prework Study Guide Webpage stores, organizes, and displays notes related to basic HTML, CSS, JS, and Git concepts. In addition, the webpage has some functionality in the console log that lists all the topics on the webpage and suggests a random topic to study. The purpose of this project was to learn basic concepts of each listed topic, how these languages work in tandem with one another, how to properly save these changes, and best practices when merging feature branch changes onto the main brain. The Git workflow was the biggest challenge that is not displayed on the website but taught me just as much as what is displayed.
